<h1>Advertising</h1> is an audio or visual form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing">marketing</a> communication that employs an openly sponsored,
non-personal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea.[1]:465 Sponsors of advertising are often businesses wishing to promote their products or services.
Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser pays for and has control over the message.
